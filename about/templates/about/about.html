                Lidya, fashion designer.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a mother of a healthy child, she recently found more use of her dormant skills in tailoring for repairing clothes,
                and with inspiration from online DIY culture and positive influences she have become a full fledged
                practitioner in the arts of sewing, stitching, patterns and seams.
                However, her experience goes back further than that as tailoring has always been a hobby for Lidya.
                <br>
                <br>
                Her ambitions may not be grandiose as of yet, but together with good friends and a good website hopefully she will get some attention
